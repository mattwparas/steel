## About

`Steel` is an embeddable scheme interpreter, with a standalone interpreter/repl included as well. The language is implemented as a bytecode virtual machine. At the moment, it is mostly compliant with R5RS, only missing `let-syntax` support. Support for R7Rs is underway.

> **Warning**
> The API is relatively stable, however it may change at any time while pre 1.0. Care will be taken to keep things backwards compatible where possible.


## Features

- [R5RS](https://standards.scheme.org/official/r5rs.pdf) support
- Modules, using `require` and `provide` much like Racket.
- `syntax-rules` and `syntax-case` macros.
- Easy integration with native Rust functions and structs, either through embedding or via FFI.
- Higher order Contracts
- Built in immutable data structures, including:
  - lists
  - vectors
  - hashmaps
  - hashsets

For more details, see the [book](https://mattwparas.github.io/steel/book)

## Getting Started

This github repository contains a cli interpreter. To try it out on the online playground, go to the [Steel playground](https://mattwparas.github.io/steel-playground/dev). To get started using a repl with the crates, make sure you first have rust installed.

Then, clone the repo and run the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will launch a REPL instance that looks something like this:

### Full install

If you'd like to install everything, just run the following command:

```bash
cargo xtask install
```

This will install:

- The steel interpreter, `steel`
- The package manager, `forge`
- The dylib installer, `cargo-steel-lib` (also available via the interpreter)
- The steel language server
- The standard library, found under the `cogs` directory

### Packages

If you would like to customize the location of installed packages, please set the `STEEL_HOME` environment variable. Steel currently follows XDG if present, and otherwise assumes the default of `$HOME/.steel` if the `STEEL_HOME` environment variable is not already set.
